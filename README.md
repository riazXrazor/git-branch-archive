# git-branch-archive
Nodejs script to archive branches.This is done by tagging them as archive/<branchname> and removing them both locally and remotely. Before each operation, the user is asked for confirmation.

When working on a project, the number of branches tend to increase linearly with the work being done and clutter the branch list. When you look at the branches, you just want to see the active branches. A common way to deal with this problem in git is to archive branches. Git doesnâ€™t natively supported the concept of an archived branch, but the usual way to emulate this is by creating a tag called archive/<branchname> and removing the branch after that. If you have many branches, it is convenient to be able to do this automatically and interactively. I wrote a little node script to make the whole thing take little time and effort.
